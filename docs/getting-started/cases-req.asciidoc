= Cases prerequisites

To view cases, you need the {kib} space `Read` privilege for the `Security` feature. To create cases and add comments, you need the `All` {kib}
space privilege for the `Security` feature.

For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

NOTE: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

You can create roles and define feature privileges at different levels to manage feature access in {kib}. {kib} privileges grant access to features within a specified {kib} space and full or partial access can be given. When setting up case feature access, make sure to configure the following:

- Base privileges for the {es-sec} solution
- Sub-feature privileges for the Cases feature
- Privileges for actions and connectors

NOTE: Privileges set at the sub-feature level will override privileges set at the base level for the {es-sec} solution. For example, if a user's role has `All` privileges for the {es-sec} solution and `None` selected for the Cases feature, they will be able to use all feature within the {es-sec} app except for cases.
